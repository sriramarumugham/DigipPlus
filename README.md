## How to use this App

hosted on vercel https://digip-plus.vercel.app/

This is a single-page react application
Used React router dom v6 for the navigation between pages
and used the nested routes for navigation between different tabs of the same pages

## Components


I have created multiple reusable components to reduce the code
